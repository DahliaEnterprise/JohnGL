Trails can determine and guide money into areas of payment that can prevent paying money with money.
To be clear it can identify debts that you have the money for but have not worked for.
For example you have a loan but you have not worked to pay if a tiny loan even though you have the money for it it can determine that you need to work to pay off that small loan while you use the large loan for an alternative mission.
This was extrapolated from federal stock market laws that which made it illegal(or regulated) to buy and sell at the same exact price with the same stock within a reasonable time frame(30 to 90 days) which caused stocks to collapse even though the numbers stayed the same and also no one was working during that period because everyone was lead to believe their was resources to cash out on(businesses running and stocks to sell)
