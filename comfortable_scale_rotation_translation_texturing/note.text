The process to a comfortable scale rotation translation during a texturing process is to have a 2d (or 3d) model, have a automated process that 
will move each triangle to a centered position, the triangle is then textured, then the triangle is placed back to its model defined position
With the scale, rotation, translation applied to the texture for each triangle this will be called the "textured model".

The textured model can then be scale, rotated, translated according to the game world scale, rotation, translation.

Once this is done to each model in the game for the intended scene the projection view can be applied.
