           the useage of quaternions are the standard;
           However stress testing by means of multiple programs
           and calibration and verification methods declares that
           quaternions only prevent drift over a short time span.
           
           Therefore the solution is to rotate three infinitely long
           lines that will point towards the intended direction
           and usually to achieve exactitude by pointing at an object
           to achieve orientation (less than negligible drift).
           
           Once the infinitely long lines are pointed the exact direction
           the vertex object will only rotate with out drift on an infinite ling timeline(longer than the known universe life and beyond)
           if all three algorithms are tried and the none drifted result is choosen.
           hence why pointing at an object(and another object such as the floor) will achieve maximum precision 
           within regards to the intended exact direction.
           
           these three algorithms will rotate in the following order
           x,y,z or y,z,x or z,y,x
           
           there are some occasions where the starting rotation can be 
           so complex that the computer must try all possible,
           methods to achieve the requested direction(not to be confused with the 
           proposed order of operations of the three algorithms previously discussed).
           which would result in unprecedented stalling in any graphics applications
           that could last for hours.
           
           In order to avoid the indefinite machine learning senario
           all objects using the proposed functions within this file must be cloned
           from the source as a zero, zero, zero, rotation and then can be rotated from
           the cloned dataset(manipulation vertex).
